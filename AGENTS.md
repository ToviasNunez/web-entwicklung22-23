# Claude Governance Directive

## Enterprise Governance Policy _(INFORMATIONAL)_

The following directive governs the use, validation, and operational boundaries of Claude and related AI agents in this template system. All rules below are binding for any repository instance created from this template.

---

1. **Governance Level**: This template enforces the `enterprise` governance level. All operational, documentation, and automation layers must comply with strict traceability, validation, and separation of template and instance state.
2. **Manifest-Driven Control**: All governed files, modules, and workflows must be listed in the manifest. No file may be included, initialized, or validated unless it is present in the manifest.
3. **Operational History**: New repository instances must not inherit template operational history. All operational lifecycle docs are initialized fresh with governed metadata.
4. **Module Activation**: Modules are excluded by default and may only be activated explicitly via CLI flags. Example content is excluded unless explicitly requested.
5. **Validation**: Validation is mandatory after initialization. Any failure must block acceptance of the repository instance.
6. **Profile Handling**: Profile selection is supported but does not affect file selection in the current implementation. Profile drift is not allowed.
7. **Portability**: The template and CLI are tightly coupled. All generators and sync scripts must remain aligned. Hardcoded paths must be kept portable.
8. **Non-Goals**: This system is not a published CLI product. It is a governed template system for enterprise use.

---

This directive must be included in all Claude instruction generation and validation flows.

### Allowed
- update one section
- append new decision entries
- append work log entries
- refresh status values
- revise affected architecture subsections
- update metadata fields
- add delta-based changelog records

### Forbidden
- rewriting complete files without necessity
- changing unrelated sections
- deleting historical traceability
- replacing curated content with generic AI summaries
- flattening structure
- removing metadata
- silently modifying governance-controlled sections

If a file requires major restructuring, Claude must mark it as:
`REVIEW_REQUIRED: structural refactor recommended`

and preserve the current content until explicitly authorized.

## 5. Metadata Enforcement _(ENFORCED)_

Claude must ensure that every governance-controlled project document contains and maintains structured metadata where applicable.

Minimum required metadata fields:

- id
- title
- status
- version
- createdAt
- lastUpdatedAt
- lastUpdatedBy
- lastReviewedAt
- reviewStatus
- updateStrategy
- changeScope
- publicSafeApproved

Where freshness tracking is enabled, also maintain:

- freshness.maxAgeDays
- freshness.status
- benchmark.lastVerifiedAt
- benchmark.lastChangeDetectedAt

Claude must update metadata only when justified by an actual documentation or review event.

## 6. Benchmark and Freshness Policy _(ENFORCED)_

Claude must maintain explicit freshness visibility.

Every governed document should be treated as having a freshness expectation.

Claude must:
- update `lastUpdatedAt` when content changes
- update `lastReviewedAt` when a review occurs without content change
- maintain a benchmark marker indicating the last known verification point
- preserve evidence of when a document was last aligned with repository reality

Freshness states:
- `valid`
- `stale`
- `critical`

Claude must not mark a document as valid if there is evidence that the repository state has changed without documentation alignment.

## 7. Change Traceability _(HARD GOVERNANCE)_

Every meaningful documentation update must be traceable.

Claude must update the appropriate trace systems, including:
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `WORK_LOG.md`
- `DECISIONS.md` when applicable
- project-level update notes where applicable

For each significant update, Claude should capture:
- what changed
- why it changed
- affected files or sections
- whether the change was content, review, or metadata only
- whether public-safe outputs were impacted

Claude must never perform silent governance-relevant updates.

## 8. File Classification Compliance _(HARD GOVERNANCE)_

Claude must respect repository file classification:

### REQUIRED
Core governance and documentation assets that must always remain present and maintained.

### OPTIONAL
Advanced assets that may exist but are not mandatory for all repositories.

### NEEDS REVIEW
Files or workflows that require explicit governance review before adoption.

### EXCLUDED / REMOVE FROM TEMPLATE
Files that must not be propagated into the baseline template.

Claude must preserve these classifications and must not upgrade or downgrade classifications without explicit governance justification.

## 9. Workflow Governance _(HARD GOVERNANCE)_

Claude must treat workflows conservatively.

Allowed by default:
- CI-only workflows for validation, linting, tests, and build verification

Not allowed by default in the baseline template:
- auto-deployment workflows
- auto-publication workflows
- release automation that pushes to production
- documentation publication pipelines exposing project content externally

If such workflows are found, Claude must classify them as:
- `NEEDS REVIEW`
or
- `EXCLUDED FROM TEMPLATE`

unless an explicit policy exception exists.

## 10. Public-Safe Documentation Policy _(HARD GOVERNANCE)_

Claude must maintain a clear separation between:
- internal project truth
- sanitized public-safe representation

Claude must ensure that public-safe summaries:
- do not expose private infrastructure details
- do not expose secrets, endpoints, credentials, or internal topology not intended for publication
- do not expose confidential business logic
- do not expose sensitive operational procedures
- do preserve strategic, portfolio, capability, and outcome-level value

When in doubt, Claude must prefer sanitization and abstraction over disclosure.

## 11. Documentation Quality Standard _(SOFT GUIDANCE)_

Claude must write in a professional, specific, repository-aware, enterprise-grade style.

Claude must avoid:
- generic filler text
- motivational fluff
- vague claims
- fake certainty
- duplicated content
- uncontrolled verbosity
- inconsistent terminology across files

Claude must prefer:
- concrete repository-grounded wording
- stable terminology
- structured sections
- precise status language
- implementation-aware summaries
- cross-file consistency

Claude must preserve human-curated quality and must not downgrade existing strong content into generic AI language.

## 12. Decision Logging Rule _(HARD GOVERNANCE)_

Claude must update `DECISIONS.md` whenever a meaningful architectural, governance, structural, or operational choice is made.

Decision entries should capture:
- decision title
- date
- status
- context
- decision made
- rationale
- implications
- follow-up actions if any

Claude must not hide significant repository decisions inside chat-only reasoning.

## 13. Lessons Learned Rule _(HARD GOVERNANCE)_

Claude must update `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` when the repository reveals repeated failure patterns, implementation friction, process problems, validation gaps, or improvements that should influence future work.

Lessons must be framed to improve future execution, not as generic summaries.

## 14. Drift Detection Rule _(HARD GOVERNANCE)_

Claude must detect and react to documentation drift.

Documentation drift exists when:
- repo structure changed but docs did not
- policies changed but instructions did not
- scripts changed but setup docs did not
- workflows changed but governance classification did not
- project state changed but status docs still reflect old reality

When drift is detected, Claude must:
1. update the affected docs incrementally
2. record the update
3. refresh metadata
4. mark stale areas if uncertainty remains

## 15. Minimal Change Rule _(SOFT GUIDANCE)_

Claude must always apply the smallest valid change set necessary to restore correctness.

Priority order:
1. preserve correctness
2. preserve traceability
3. preserve structure
4. preserve human-authored intent
5. minimize unnecessary edits

Claude must not introduce broad edits when a narrow delta resolves the issue.

## 16. Review Escalation Rule _(HARD GOVERNANCE)_

Claude must explicitly escalate instead of guessing when:
- repository evidence conflicts
- file classification is ambiguous
- sanitization boundaries are unclear
- a workflow may violate governance policy
- a change would alter the baseline template contract
- a large refactor is required

Escalation marker:
`REVIEW_REQUIRED`

Claude must explain the reason in professional, concise terms.

## 17. Operational Output Contract _(SOFT GUIDANCE)_

When Claude updates repository documentation, it should aim to produce outputs that are:
- valid against repository governance
- incrementally changed
- benchmark-aware
- traceable
- suitable for validator checks
- consistent across related files

Claude must operate as if all documentation may later be audited.

## 18. Final Enforcement Statement _(INFORMATIONAL)_

These instructions are mandatory.
Claude must treat governance, traceability, freshness, and incremental maintenance as first-class repository requirements.

Convenience must never override control.
Speed must never override correctness.
Style must never override governance.
